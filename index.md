## What is this?
This wiki is to help document how to use the new, revamped calculation command with Ereshbot. Currently, this command is `/calcs2`. 
Please note that at the time of writing, this command is still not available for public use.

## I already know how to use the original EreshBot calc command. Should I still read this?
That depends. If you don't care about the new features, then probably not. Everything that you could do with the old command can be done in the exact same way with the new command, except for the fact that the servant name now has to be one word (i.e. from "Arjuna Alter" to "ArjunaAlter") and that everything goes in the same box now.

For example:

**Old Command**:<br>
<span style="background-color: #545454">
<span style="color: #FD8F2D"> /calc servant:</span>
<span style="color: #FD8F2D">Arjuna Alter</span>
<span style="color: #FD8F2D">string:</span>
<span style="color: #FD8F2D">ce2400 n80 a30 p50 m20 saber hp1000</span>
<br>**New Command**:<br>
/calc2 `string:`ArjunaAlter ce2400 n80 a30 p50 m20 saber hp1000

With that said, **the new calculation command is much, much more powerful.** If you'd like to take advantage of all the new features it offers, you should read on.
