## How To Actually *Use* The Calculation Command
Like EreshBot's other commands, the calculation command is a slash command.
To utilize slash commands, you'll want to first input the character `/` into your chat box.
When you do this, any and all slash commands available to you from all of the bots in your server
(not just EreshBot!) will appear as a list. You'll know that a command is an EreshBot command if it has the

After entering `/` into the chat box and pulling up the list of slash commands, you'll want to type out `calc` 
to search for the command in question. Once you find the EreshBot command named `calc`, you'll want to hit your enter
key to select it.

Once you've hit the enter key and selected the `calc` command, a box labeled `string` will appear. This will be where 
you will enter what we call your
<span style="color: #209e5f"> calculation string</span>. This is the text that you use to tell EreshBot what it is you
want to calculate.
